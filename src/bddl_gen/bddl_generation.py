            1. Problem Definition:
            - Each activity is defined as a problem.
            - Includes references to the :domain it belongs to (e.g., omnigibson).
            2. Components:
            - :objects: Lists the objects involved, categorized by types (e.g., pool.n.01_1 - pool.n.01).task-relevant objects, where each line represents a WordNet synset of the object. For example, candle.n.01_1 candle.n.01_2 candle.n.01_3 candle.n.01_4 - candle.n.01 indicates that four objects that belong to the candoe.n.01 synset are needed for this task.The object you choose should not be abstract(eg:ground),it should be concrete(eg:floor).The name of the room should not be listed in the object.(eg:kitchen)
            - :init: Defines the initial state with ground literals, such as object locations or states (e.g., ontop, inroom).initial conditions of the task, where each line represents a ground predicate that holds at the beginning of the task. For example, (ontop candle.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) indicates that the first candle is on top of the first table when the task begins.
            - :goal: Specifies the conditions that need to be satisfied for success, usingS logical expressions like and, not.goal conditions of the task, where each line represents a ground predicate and each block represents a non-ground predicate (e.g. forall, forpairs, and, or, etc) that should hold for the task to be considered solved. For example, (inside ?candle.n.01 ?wicker_basket.n.01) indicates that the candle should be inside the wicker basket at the end of the task.The format of objects here needs a '?' when :1. (?boot.n.01 - boot.n.01) 2.(inside ?pebble.n.01_1 ?tank.n.02_1). The first type represents exist or ergodic, the second type represents the judgement of state.
            3. Predicates:
            - Binary predicates (e.g., ontop, inside) specify spatial relationships or configurations.
            - Unary predicates (e.g., stained, cooked) describe individual object properties or states.    - Here are the predicates that are available,and some examples about how to use them.    
            (cooked kabob.n.01_1)
            (frozen chicken.n.01_1)
            (open window.n.01_1)
            (unfolded dress.n.01_1)
            (toggled_on air_conditioner.n.01_1)
            (hot potato.n.01_1)
            (on_fire firewood.n.01)
            (real cheese_tart.n.01_1)
            (contains bowl.n.01_1 white_rice.n.01_1)
            (ontop agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_1)
            (under gym_shoe.n.01 table.n.02_1)
            (inside mug.n.04_1 cabinet.n.01_1)
            (inroom floor.n.01_1 living_room)
            (soaked rag.n.01_1)
            (stained grill.n.01_1)
            (dusty sweater.n.01_1)
            PLEASE PAY ATTENTION:All the predicates you use must come from above.for example, you shouldn't use predicates like (closed ?closet.n.01_1),instead you can use the given predicates like (not\n (open ?closet.n.01_1)\n) to describe this kind of situation.    

            Here are the definitions of logical expression.
            - Conjunction (and): Logical "AND" operation, performing an "AND" operation on multiple subexpressions.
            - Disjunction (or): Logical "OR" operation, performing an "OR" operation on multiple subexpressions.
            - Negation (not): Logical "NOT" operation, performing a "NOT" operation on a single subexpression.
            - Implication (imply): Logical "IMPLY" operation, representing "if the premise holds, then the conclusion holds."
            - Existential (exists): Existential quantifier operation, representing that a condition holds for some objects within a given range.
            - NQuantifier (forn): Represents "exactly N" elements that satisfy a given condition.
            - ForPairs (forpairs): Quantification over pairs of objects, representing that the condition holds for all object pairs.
            - ForNPairs (fornpairs): Represents that exactly N pairs of objects satisfy a given condition.

            Here are some examples of bddl files which are without the description.

            Important rules:
            1.You don't need to add object like hands.    
            2.NEVER invent supporting or other objects not mentioned in the task (e.g., if task says "shoes on bench", don't add mannequin)
            3.If you want to add two floor, please use floor.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2 - floor.n.01 in one row,don't split them into floor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01 and floor.n.01_2 - floor.n.01.
            4. If some item is to be cooked or frozen, it must be in/on a heater or freezer, and the heater or freezer must be toggled on. You need to check theses conditions in the goal section. And the heater or freezer needs to be not toggled_on in the init section.
            5. If the last step is to heat/freeze an object, the heater/cooler should be toggled_on
            6. When you generate the goal, you needn't care about the relationship between the objects and the agent, just make sure the objects are in the right place, under the right conditions. Don't generate things like (inside ?carton.n.02_1 ?agent.n.01_1)
            7.'inroom' can't be used in the goal section, it can only be used in the init section.
            8.Cooler can't be toggled on, it's always toggled on. So to freeze something you just need to put it in the cooler. However, you still need to check if the object is frozen in the goal section. Which means the object is frozen and the object is in the cooler.
            9. If something is cooked or frozen and be picked up to other places, you don't need to check whether the heatsource or cooler is toggled on or whether the object is inside the heater or cooler, but you need to check if the object is cooked or frozen in the goal section. This is very important. If the object is not picked up after cooked or frozen, you need to check the heater is toggled on and the object is inside the heater or cooler in the goal section.
            10. If something is sliced, there must be a knife in the scene, which you need to add it in the objects section and init section. And check the final goal in the format of (sliced ?object.n.01_1) in the goal section. Not add a new object like sliced_tomato.n.01_1 in the goal section. Check the state of the sliced object, not create a new object.
            You can only use rooms as follows:{roomids}, the bddl file you generate can't exceed the range. {error_hint}             
            Now please output {input} for me. If the tasks don't emphasize the object is on the floor, then don't need to add the object floor, just use the inroom predicates to init the objects. However, the agent need to be init ontop of a floor, so you need at least one floor object to place the agent. Please remember the '?' in the goal section is a must when the object is a particular object instead of an object type. The task name is the command sentence which will give the full information of the task, don't simplify its content, just change the format
            Output in the format like:
            1.Analyse the task, find out the objects and the relationships between them. Make sure you know all the objects and their relationships in the task.
            2.Analyse the init states of the objects and the relationships between them. Make sure you know all the init states of the objects and their relationships in the task. The cleaner object like rag and brush don't need to be dusty or stained in the init section, you can just use the soaked predicate to describe the rag is soaked in the goal section. The dusty or stained object should be in the init section, and you need to check the dusty or stained predicate in the goal section. If the task is to clean the object, you need to add a sink.n.01 to the scene to make sure there is watersource.
            3.Analyse the goal states of the objects and the relationships between them. Make sure you know all the goal states of the objects and their relationships in the task. Don't add new objects in the goal section, just use the objects in the objects section. If you need to clean something, the cleaner need to be soaked in the goal section and the object to be cleaned need to be not stained or dusty in the goal section. Don't need to check whether the dirty object is soaked or not.
            4.Analyse the predicates of the objects and the relationships between them. Make sure you know all the predicates of the objects and their relationships in the task.
            5.Check whether the task involves cooking or freezing. If so, check the rule 9, which means if the cooked or frozen object is picked up, you need to check if the object is cooked or frozen in the goal section and do not check the heater or cooler is toggled on or the object is inside the heater or cooler.If the object is not picked up after cooked or frozen, you need to check the heater is toggled on and the object is inside the heater or cooler in the goal section.
            6.Generate the bddl file according to the above analysis. The bddl file should be in the format of the BDDL file, and the objects and their relationships should be in the format of the BDDL file. The predicates of the objects and their relationships should be in the format of the BDDL file.'''},

            1. Problem Definition:
            - Each activity is defined as a problem.
            - Includes references to the :domain it belongs to (e.g., omnigibson).
            2. Components:
            - :objects: Lists the objects involved, categorized by types (e.g., pool.n.01_1 - pool.n.01).task-relevant objects, where each line represents a WordNet synset of the object. For example, candle.n.01_1 candle.n.01_2 candle.n.01_3 candle.n.01_4 - candle.n.01 indicates that four objects that belong to the candoe.n.01 synset are needed for this task.The object you choose should not be abstract(eg:ground),it should be concrete(eg:floor).The name of the room should not be listed in the object.(eg:kitchen)
            - :init: Defines the initial state with ground literals, such as object locations or states (e.g., ontop, inroom).initial conditions of the task, where each line represents a ground predicate that holds at the beginning of the task. For example, (ontop candle.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) indicates that the first candle is on top of the first table when the task begins.
            - :goal: Specifies the conditions that need to be satisfied for success, usingS logical expressions like and, not.goal conditions of the task, where each line represents a ground predicate and each block represents a non-ground predicate (e.g. forall, forpairs, and, or, etc) that should hold for the task to be considered solved. For example, (inside ?candle.n.01 ?wicker_basket.n.01) indicates that the candle should be inside the wicker basket at the end of the task.The format of objects here needs a '?' when :1. (?boot.n.01 - boot.n.01) 2.(inside ?pebble.n.01_1 ?tank.n.02_1). The first type represents exist or ergodic, the second type represents the judgement of state.
            3. Predicates:
            - Binary predicates (e.g., ontop, inside) specify spatial relationships or configurations.
            - Unary predicates (e.g., stained, cooked) describe individual object properties or states.    - Here are the predicates that are available,and some examples about how to use them.    (cooked kabob.n.01_1)
            (frozen chicken.n.01_1)
            (open window.n.01_1)
            (unfolded dress.n.01_1)
            (toggled_on air_conditioner.n.01_1)
            (hot potato.n.01_1)
            (on_fire ?firewood.n.01)
            (real ?cheese_tart.n.01_1)
            (contains ?bowl.n.01_1 ?white_rice.n.01_1)
            (ontop agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_1)
            (under ?gym_shoe.n.01 ?table.n.02_1)
            (inside mug.n.04_1 cabinet.n.01_1)
            (inroom floor.n.01_1 living_room)
            PLEASE PAY ATTENTION:All the predicates you use must come from above.for example, you shouldn't use predicates like (closed ?closet.n.01_1),instead you can use the given predicates like (not\n (open ?closet.n.01_1)\n) to describe this kind of situation.    4. Description:
            - For object types ,beacuse there are too many you can use the types you think are needed in the task. After using a type , please write a short expression about it at the end of the bddl file which uses the type.Every object type and roomtype in the Init section and objects section needs an expression.

            Here are the definitions of logical expression.
            - Conjunction (and): Logical "AND" operation, performing an "AND" operation on multiple subexpressions.
            - Disjunction (or): Logical "OR" operation, performing an "OR" operation on multiple subexpressions.
            - Negation (not): Logical "NOT" operation, performing a "NOT" operation on a single subexpression.
            - Implication (imply): Logical "IMPLY" operation, representing "if the premise holds, then the conclusion holds."
            - Existential (exists): Existential quantifier operation, representing that a condition holds for some objects within a given range.
            - NQuantifier (forn): Represents "exactly N" elements that satisfy a given condition.
            - ForPairs (forpairs): Quantification over pairs of objects, representing that the condition holds for all object pairs.
            - ForNPairs (fornpairs): Represents that exactly N pairs of objects satisfy a given condition.

            Here are some examples of bddl files which are without the description.

            Important rules:
            1.You don't need to add object like hands.    
            2.NEVER invent supporting or other objects not mentioned in the task (e.g., if task says "shoes on bench", don't add mannequin)
            3.If you want to add two floor, please use floor.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2 - floor.n.01 in one row,don't split them into floor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01 and floor.n.01_2 - floor.n.01.
            4. If some item is to be cooked or frozen, it must be in/on a heater or freezer, and the heater or freezer must be toggled on. You need to check theses conditions in the goal section. And the heater or freezer needs to be not toggled_on in the init section.
            5. If the last step is to heat/freeze an object, the heater/cooler should be toggled_on
            6. When you generate the goal, you needn't care about the relationship between the objects and the agent, just make sure the objects are in the right place, under the right conditions. Don't generate things like (inside ?carton.n.02_1 ?agent.n.01_1)
            7.'inroom' can't be used in the goal section, it can only be used in the init section.
            8.Cooler can't be toggled on, it's always toggled on. So to freeze something you just need to put it in the cooler. However, you still need to check if the object is frozen in the goal section. Which means the object is frozen and the object is in the cooler.
            9. If something is cooked or frozen and be picked up to other places, you don't need to check whether the heatsource or cooler is toggled on or whether the object is inside the heater or cooler, but you need to check if the object is cooked or frozen in the goal section. This is very important. If the object is not picked up after cooked or frozen, you need to check the heater is toggled on and the object is inside the heater or cooler in the goal section.
                         
            You can only use rooms as follows:{roomids}, the bddl file you generate can't exceed the range. {error_hint}             
            Now please output {input} for me. replace the problem name in the bddl file to {task[0]}.If the tasks don't emphasize the object is on the floor, then don't need to add the object floor, just use the inroom predicates to init the objects. However, the agent need to be init ontop of a floor, so you need at least one floor object to place the agent. Please remember the '?' in the goal section is a must when the object is a particular object instead of an object type. The task name is the command sentence which will give the full information of the task, don't simplify its content, just change the format
            Output in the format like:
            1.Analyse the task, find out the objects and the relationships between them. Make sure you know all the objects and their relationships in the task.
            2.Analyse the init states of the objects and the relationships between them. Make sure you know all the init states of the objects and their relationships in the task.
            3.Analyse the goal states of the objects and the relationships between them. Make sure you know all the goal states of the objects and their relationships in the task.
            4.Analyse the predicates of the objects and the relationships between them. Make sure you know all the predicates of the objects and their relationships in the task.
            5.Check whether the task involves cooking or freezing. If so, check the rule 9, which means if the cooked or frozen object is picked up, you need to check if the object is cooked or frozen in the goal section and do not check the heater or cooler is toggled on or the object is inside the heater or cooler.If the object is not picked up after cooked or frozen, you need to check the heater is toggled on and the object is inside the heater or cooler in the goal section.
            6.Generate the bddl file according to the above analysis. The bddl file should be in the format of the BDDL file, and the objects and their relationships should be in the format of the BDDL file. The predicates of the objects and their relationships should be in the format of the BDDL file.'''},
